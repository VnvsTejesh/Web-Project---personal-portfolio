# CS 463/563 – Intro to Web Development Final Project
##My Portfolio 

This is a website that showcases my personal portfolio, featuring information about my professional background, completed projects, and a contact form. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and includes several pages for easy navigation. Visitors can see the below following:

•	Navigation Bar
•	About Me
•	Previous Experience
•	Projects
•	Contact Form

##How to run the code

To execute the code, there are two options available for accessing the repository. One can either clone it by running the appropriate command (git clone) in the terminal or download it as a zip file and extract the files locally. Once the project files are obtained, launching the index.html file on any web browser will display the website. The HTML file is already linked to the essential JavaScript and CSS files, and all website sections are accessible via the navigation bar. It's worth noting that the website has been designed with a responsive layout, optimized for different screen resolutions. 

## Key Features

•	The project utilized HTML, JavaScript, and CSS flexbox to achieve its goals. 
•	To customize and style scalable vector icons, the project utilized fonts from Font Awesome, which offers a vast collection of free icons. 
•	To ensure accessibility, the WAVE accessibility extension and Lighthouse, a part of dev tools, were used. 
•	The website was designed mobile-first and employs various media queries to adapt to different screen sizes. For smaller screens, the navigation bar and font sizes are smaller, whereas larger screens display a bigger layout, larger fonts, and a bigger navigation bar. 
•	For individuals with low vision, larger screens are recommended to utilize bigger font sizes and the navigation bar. The website has been thoroughly tested on 414px, 768px, and 1024px screen sizes.
