            <h2>IRC Project</h2>
            <p class="project_para">
              This internet relay chat system was developed by a team of three
              members, including myself. Our collaborative efforts resulted in
              the creation of a single IRC server and an IRC client interface to
              enable users to connect and communicate using personalized
              usernames. In our pursuit to start small, we focused primarily on
              implementing chat functionality for the system's first semester.
              However, we have ambitious goals for this project's future,
              including the incorporation of voice functionality and secure
              messaging features.

            <p class="project_para">
              As a part of our Software Engineering project, I have participated
              in a comprehensive analysis for the usability of Click & Split
              app. Based on our findings, we implemented and redesign that
              included the incorporation of an end-to-end image recognition
              feature, thereby enhancing the overall user experience. My
              proficiency in node.js was critical in the development of the
              backend, while my skills in HTML/CSS were utilized to create an
              intuitive frontend. To ensure optimal functionality, I conducted
              rigorous unit testing on the backend split bill logic using
              industry-standard JavaScript test frameworks, mocha and chai.
