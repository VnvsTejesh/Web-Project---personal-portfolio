              <p class="project_para">
                This internet relay chat system was developed by a team of three
                members, including myself. Our collaborative efforts resulted in
                the creation of a single IRC server and an IRC client interface
                to enable users to connect and communicate using personalized
                usernames. In our pursuit to start small, we focused primarily
                on implementing chat functionality for the system's first
                semester. However, we have ambitious goals for this project's
                future, including the incorporation of voice functionality and
                secure messaging features.

                As a part of our Software Engineering project, I have
                participated in a comprehensive analysis for the usability of
                Click & Split app. Based on our findings, we implemented and
                redesign that included the incorporation of an end-to-end image
                recognition feature, thereby enhancing the overall user
                experience. My proficiency in node.js was critical in the
                development of the backend, while my skills in HTML/CSS were
                utilized to create an intuitive frontend. To ensure optimal
                functionality, I conducted rigorous unit testing on the backend
                split bill logic using industry-standard JavaScript test
                frameworks, mocha and chai.
